Mapped *.smallpict.com to my Nodejitsu server

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added the hostname to the string echoed on each request.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added the wildcard to the domains element in the package.json file, although the Nodejitsu docs don't say anything about how to have a whole domain map to a NJ app.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven't been able to test it because NJ is calling an error on loading the new version, version 0.65.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with a lot of this stuff, I'm floating on air, not sure what I'm doing, trying things out, and looking for something that works. 



Started the worknotes file, to document work I'm actively doing on fargoPublisher. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/fargoPublisher/blob/master/opml/worknotes.opml">outline</a> in the OPML folder, and a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/fargoPublisher/blob/master/worknotes.md">markdown file</a> at the top level.
