Started the worknotes file, to document work I'm actively doing on fargoPublisher. 

It's an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/fargoPublisher/blob/master/opml/worknotes.opml">outline</a> in the OPML folder, and a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/fargoPublisher/blob/master/worknotes.md">markdown file</a> at the top level.
